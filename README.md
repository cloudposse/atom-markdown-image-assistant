Add sane drag and drop and copy/paste support for images to markdown
files. This is especially useful for notetaking in Atom.

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 





## Usage

## Atom Settings

These settings can be accessed under Settings -> Packages -> Markdown
Image Assistant.

### Default Settings

Whenever an image is dragged and dropped or copy and pasted on an open markdown file, this package automatically copies it to an `assets/` folder in the current directory, renames the image, and inserts a relative link to the image.

### Active file types

File type that image assistant should activate for

### Image directory

Default image directory

### Preserve original file names

When dragging and dropping files, whether to preserve original file names when copying over into the image directory

### Use the Markdown filename

Creates an asset folder in the form of `<fileroot>.assets/`.  Where
`<fileroot>` is the root of the file without the supported Markdown extensions (`.markdown`, `.md`, `.mdown`, `.mkd`, `.mkdow`).


### Insert image as Markup, instead of Markdown

Insert an image as HTML Markup, `<img src=''>`, instead of Markdown, `![]()`.  Useful if you want to adjust image `width` or `height`
